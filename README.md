# Project Name

ACE MIND AI

## 🧠 Description

Ace Mind AI is an intelligent, AI-native academic orchestrator designed to transform how students manage their educational journey. Moving beyond simple static calendars, Ace Mind AI utilizes a Generative Language Model (GLM) to act as a personal academic strategist.

The technical scope involves a multi-step agentic workflow that processes student behavioral data to autonomously generate optimized study schedules and provide predictive grade analytics. Our design decision focuses on proactive intervention—shifting the student's role from a manual planner to an informed curator of their own academic success.

# 📦 Installation

git clone https://github.com/Ivanyong07/ACE-MIND-AI.git
cd ACE-MIND-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 🔑 Genrate A Secret Key

python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

# Create .env file

create a file name .env in project/.env
go to https://groq.com/ generate a api key

inside .env:
GROQ_API_KEY = PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY
DEBUG = TRUE

# 🤖 ML Model Setup

Before running the server, train the model:
cd project/ml
python train.py

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle:

- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borovai0/student-performance-analytics-dataset

The dataset is used for training the machine learning model for academic performance prediction.
After downloaded drag the dataset to the folder (example: project/ml/student_performance)

⚠️ Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing. Please download it from the link above.

## 🧠 Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using a Kaggle dataset.
